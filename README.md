**Project Description: ATM Simulator with Enhanced Security and Standard Limits**

This project is a **realistic ATM simulator** designed to replicate the functionality of a real-world Automated Teller Machine (ATM). The program is built using **C++** and incorporates **object-oriented programming principles** to create a secure, user-friendly, and feature-rich banking system. The simulator allows users to perform standard banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, PIN changes, and transaction history tracking. Additionally, it includes **enhanced security features** and **standard banking limits** to ensure a safe and reliable experience for users.

The simulator begins with a **user authentication process**, where users must enter their **PIN** to access their account. To enhance security, the PIN input is hidden using a custom function that prevents it from being displayed on the screen. If the user enters an incorrect PIN multiple times (up to 3 attempts), the account is **locked** to prevent unauthorized access. This feature mimics real-world ATM behavior, where accounts are temporarily locked after repeated failed login attempts.

Once authenticated, users are presented with a **menu-driven interface** that allows them to perform various banking operations. They can **check their account balance**, **deposit money**, or **withdraw funds**. The withdrawal feature is subject to **daily limits** (e.g., rs50,000 per day) and **minimum balance requirements** (e.g., rs1,000), ensuring that users adhere to standard banking regulations. Deposits and withdrawals are recorded in the user's **transaction history**, which includes timestamps for each transaction. Users can also **change their PIN**, with the system enforcing a **strong PIN policy** that requires the new PIN to be at least 4 digits long.

The program also includes a **transaction history feature**, which allows users to view a detailed log of all their transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and PIN changes. Each transaction is timestamped, providing users with a clear and accurate record of their banking activities. This feature is particularly useful for tracking expenses and identifying any unauthorized transactions.

To further enhance security, the program uses **password hiding** during PIN entry, preventing shoulder surfing or accidental exposure of sensitive information. Additionally, the system enforces **daily withdrawal limits** and **minimum balance requirements**, ensuring that users cannot overdraw their accounts or exceed standard banking limits. These features make the simulator not only functional but also secure and compliant with real-world banking standards.

Overall, this ATM simulator is a **comprehensive and practical project** that demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming, data structures, and security best practices in a real-world application. It is designed to be user-friendly, with clear prompts and error messages guiding users through each operation. The project is ideal for learning and demonstrating core programming concepts while simulating a real-world banking environment. Whether used for educational purposes or as a foundation for more advanced systems, this ATM simulator provides a robust and secure platform for managing banking transactions.
